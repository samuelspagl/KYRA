| Fukter | Lets you filter the signal |
| Pitchshifter | Does what it says 😂 |
| Saturator | Saturates the signal, but can also distort it |
| Feedback-Delay | A Feedback-Delay |
| Der-Delay | Just another type of delay 🤷🏻‍♂️ |

#### Credits 

Not all of this was made by my own, Tim Eichelbaum also made some modules and the hardware integration (discountinued)
The patch "yafr.maxpat" is a Plate reverb, in the style of Griesinger. Randy Jones rej@2uptech.com
